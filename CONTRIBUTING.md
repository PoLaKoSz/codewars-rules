# How to contribute

There are several ways you can contribute. First of all, you could
file an [issue][file issue] if you encounter one. However, it is
even better if you create a [pull request] where you fix the issue
yourself.


# Conventions

- Lines shouldn't be longer than 80 characters.  Try to justify the
  text as most as possible, so that it can be read with `less` or
  another pager easily. You can use `pandoc` for this, see the
  `reformat` rule in this repositories `makefile`.
- Don't use inline links in Markdown. Instead, use `[text][name]`
  and set the URL later.
- We use British spelling, e.g. "behaviour" instead of "behavior",
  "fulfil" instead of "fulfill" and similar.  Since this is mostly
  a text document, make sure that your
- Two newlines before a heading, one newline after.
- Put a newline at the end of a file.


# Licensing
