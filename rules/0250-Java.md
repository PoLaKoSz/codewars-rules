Java
----

Codewars' Java test framework uses [JUnit](http://junit.org/) version 4.11.
The latest version at this point is 4.12, so make sure to check the
framework's documentation for recent changes if you encounter problems. The
functionality you use might not be in JUnit 4.11.

### Beware of the assert arguments!
JUnit differs from the other frameworks. Very. Much. Well, overall it doesn't,
it still has `assertEquals`, `assertArrayEquals` and others. But the
order of arguments is swapped.

Where CoffeeScript, Ruby, Python and Haskell expect the first argument of
`Test.assert_equals`/`Test.assertEquals`/`shouldBe` to be the actual value and
the second to be the expected, JUnit swaps the order, see the documentation of
[Assert][assert-java]:

``` java
assertEquals(double expected, double actual); // note: use delta variant!
assertEquals(float  expected, float  actual); // note: use delta variant!
assertEquals(long   expected, long   actual);
// many other
```

For comparison, here's the syntax of an equality assert in the other languages:

``` haskell
-- Haskell
actual `shouldBe` expected
```
``` javascript
// Javascript
Test.assertEquals(actual, expected, message);
```
``` python
# Python
Test.assert_equals(actual, expected, message)
```
``` ruby
# Ruby
Test.assert_equals(actual, expected, message)
```

Keep this in mind. Your tests won't fail on correct solutions if you swap the
arguments, but they __will__ confuse anyone who fails them. By the way, CSharp
uses the same convention. This isn't surprising, since its testing framework
NUnit was inspired by JUnit.
